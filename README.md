## Description

Over the past few months I've been using Vim to write my notes and using Obsidian as a way to view and edit them on my other devices (phone, tablet etc.). Currently, I have been using a shell script to help me to do this but I wanted an excuse to learn and start writing some Golang hence the creation of this project.

## Installation

To install `sb` use the provided install script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Aadam-Ali/second-brain-cli
cd second-brain-cli
./install.sh
```

Or navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/Aadam-Ali/second-brain-cli/releases).

## Usage

Usage information can be found by running the following commands:

```bash
# This will output a list of all available commands
sb help

# These will output usage information for the specified command
sb help [command]
sb [command] --help
```

## Contributing

For now this is a hobby project, so I haven't invested any time into writing up a contribution guide.

However, if there are improvements that people would like to make I'd be happy to accept issues / PRs.
